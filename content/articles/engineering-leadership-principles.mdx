Leading a platform team requires balancing product thinking with internal service reliability.

1. **Clarify the contract.** Document supported use cases and set clear expectations with consumers.
2. **Invest in enablement.** Treat documentation, examples, and onboarding as core features.
3. **Measure outcomes.** Track adoption, upgrade frequency, and time-to-ship for internal customers.

These principles create space for autonomy while maintaining alignment with business goals.
